# xbmp-reversing

The 2003 video game _The Hobbit_ uses an unusual image format called XBMP for storing its resources, including textures, UI elements, and anywhere else an image is needed. The PC version of the game simply uses a list of pixel values, while the PS2 version does an interesting palletization, where a color table is built, and then every pixel is a single byte indexing into that table. I've nearly decoded the PS2 version, but it's not quite there. If anyone else wants to monkey with it and see if they can get the right output, that would be very cool.

I have many more test images I can upload if useful. I'm also on the lookout for Gamecube or Xbox versions of the game (only looking for physical discs, not downloads). They may give further information.

Thanks for any help, and let me know if you have questions!
